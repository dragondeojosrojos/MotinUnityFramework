The HOTween engine is a separate download, which you'll need. You can find it on the Asset Store too.

IN SHORT
---------------------------
HOTween Visual Editor is composed of two separate but similar elements.

THE MANAGER
Accessed via the Window > HOTween Visual Editor command. Creates an HOTweenManager object in your hierarchy, through which you can animate any public property of any GameObject or Component present in your scene.

THE COMPONENT
Works like the Manager, but is attached directly to a GameObject like a regular component (via the Component > HOTween > HOTweenComponent menu command), and can animate any public property of any Component attached to that GameObject. Its main power is that it works greatly with prefabs in your Project Panel.
